# ðŸ“Œ ImageStitchingCPP-BoschProject

This repository presents a C++-based image stitching application built using OpenCV. The project was developed as part of the **Bosch Autovision Challenge**, showcasing a robust approach to stitching multiple images into a panorama using ORB features and homography-based alignment.

---

## ðŸ§  Project Overview

This application:
- Accepts multiple input images via CLI
- Detects keypoints and computes descriptors using ORB
- Matches features and performs homography estimation
- Stitches the images together into a panoramic output
- Includes static-linked executables and pre-generated results for demo purposes
